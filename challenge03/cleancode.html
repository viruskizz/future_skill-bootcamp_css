                <strong>Final Fantasy XII</strong> is the twelfth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, developed and published by Square Enix, and the fourth game set in the world of Ivalice. It was released in March 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and was later re-released in Japan as an international version titled Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System, with heavy changes made to the character development system by introducing jobs. This version was re-released worldwide for PlayStation 4 in July 2017, and for Steam in February 2018, as an HD remaster containing new updates, titled Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age. Final Fantasy XII was directed by Hiroyuki Ito, who also designed the battle system and supervised The Zodiac Age, with Akihiko Yoshida designing the main characters and Hitoshi Sakimoto producing the musical score. Later, on April 30, 2019 it was released for Nintendo Switch with minor updates.
    The game is set in the continent of Ivalice, in which the Archadian and Rozarrian Empires wage an endless war for power, and Dalmasca has been caught between the two and annexed by Archadia. Dalmasca's princess, Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca, has created a resistance movement against Archadia to avenge her fallen kingdom, and along the way is united with a band of allies to seek a power capable of defeating the Archadian Empire.
